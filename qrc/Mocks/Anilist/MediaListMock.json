Until, that is, he's sent to help clean the pool as punishment and is partnered with the school's resident \"bad girl\", the very real, very three-dimensional Iroha Igarashi. Brash, beautiful, and known for her promiscuous behavior, Iroha is loathed by other girls but loved by the guys. And yet, inexplicably, she not only seems to be interested in Hikari, but proposes that they enter into a relationship! Unable to resist, Hikari agrees, but there's one big catch - Iroha's moving away in six months, so no matter what happens between them, in half a year Hikari's guaranteed to lose his REAL GIRL!<br><br>\n\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)",

A serious student, he has already acquired a broad knowledge of the world and the universe, and he keeps notebooks in which he records day-to-day observations from his studies, explorations, and experiments. In May, some Adélie penguins appear in the town where he lives. They are captured and hauled away by truck, but then they vanish into thin air while being transported. Aoyama talks about the penguins with a young woman who works at the dentist’s office and who has been a friend to him. The woman is referred to only as Onee-san. When Onee-san tosses a soda can one day, it turns into a penguin. Meanwhile, Aoyama’s classmate Uchida has secretly been keeping a penguin, but it hasn’t touched its food for three weeks. When Aoyama and Uchida take it with them on the train, it disappears. Another classmate, a girl named Hamamoto who often plays chess with Aoyama, discovers a strange spherical object in a field on the edge of town. The three classmates name the sphere “Ocean,” and begin keeping a log of their observations of it. Aoyama soon concludes that there is a relationship between the swelling and shrinking of “Ocean” and Onee-san’s state of health.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Official Website)",

Hyakkimaru's father, a greedy feudal lord, had made a pact with 12 demons, offering his yet-unborn son's body parts in exchange for great power. Thus, Hyakkimaru - who was born without arms, legs, eyes, ears, a nose or a mouth - was abandoned in a river as a baby. Rescued and raised by Dr. Honma, who equips him with artificial limbs and teaches him sword-fighting techniques, Hyakkimaru discovers that each time he slays a demon, a piece of his body is restored. Now, he roams the war-torn countryside in search of demons.",
